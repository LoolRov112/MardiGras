        <h1><span class="mardi">Mardi</span><span class="gras"> Gras </span>in New Orleans
        </h1>
        <p class="aboutMardi">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
            Orleans. Celebrations
            are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
            have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In
            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
            balls (some
            of them masquerade balls).

            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route
            each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights
            of Momus and
            the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
            (often featuring
            celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure Club—a
            predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
            common throws are
            strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
            inexpensive toys.
            Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in
            the Uptown and
            Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the
            French
            Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the
            Faubourg
            Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes
            with the
            "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>
        <h2 class="history">History</h2>
        <h3 class="h3About">Early history</h3>
        <p class="aboutMardi">The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the
            Mississippi River in
            what is now
            lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as
            part of an
            observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
            unknown. A 1730
            account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
            cross-dressing).

            An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of
            masks in the
            streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever
            such
            restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.
            <br><br>
            In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money to
            fund an
            official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous
            Pieces
            describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835:

            Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic,
            and comic
            masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys,
            women and
            girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque,
            quizzical,
            diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds,
            beasts and birds
            with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the
            moon;
            mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts,
            coaches, cars,
            &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling,
            fifeing, and
            all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

            In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
            observe Mardi Gras
            with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus.
            According to one
            historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a
            French
            festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had
            passed from
            French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its
            Creoles. To a
            certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how
            their business
            prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival
            passed from
            Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The
            spectacle of
            Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and
            on the
            streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."

            In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
            conditions
            sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World
            War I and
            World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

            The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co. The
            rumored but
            long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one
            transporting a
            live ox.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3About">20th and 21st centuries</h3>
        <p class="aboutMardi">In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were
            canceled or moved to
            surrounding
            communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the city.
            Masking,
            costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen
            prevented crimes
            against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these
            reasons, some
            in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

            In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
            Mardi Gras
            Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual
            orientation,
            to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded
            that these
            krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the
            distinctly
            private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to
            demand
            otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did
            parade in
            the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

            Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal
            courts later
            declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
            association, and an
            unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The US Supreme Court
            refused to hear
            the city's appeal from this decision.

            Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues,
            and any member
            can have a place on a parade float.

            Effects of Hurricane Katrina
            The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a few people to question the future of
            the city's
            Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried to play this sentiment
            for
            electoral advantage need. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too important to the
            city's
            revival.

            The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back celebration to
            limit strains
            on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so
            negotiations
            between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less
            severely than
            originally suggested.
            The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through Marigny
            and the
            French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were several parades on
            Saturday,
            February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades followed daily from Thursday night
            through Mardi
            Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades going through Algiers, all New Orleans parades were
            restricted
            to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant
            flooding. Some
            krewes unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage
            suffered by
            that neighborhood.

            The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late at night they could end. National
            Guard troops
            assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State troopers also assisted, as they
            have many
            times in the past. Many floats had been partially submerged in floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes
            repaired and
            removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of
            the floats.

            Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly affected by the storm's
            aftermath. Many
            had lost most or all of their possessions, but enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense as an
            affirmation of life.
            The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and
            tribulations
            of living in the devastated city. References included MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along
            with much
            mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national politicians.

            By the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to the Mid-City route, and other Krewes expanding their
            parades
            Uptown.

        <h3 class="h3About">2020 tandem float incidents</h3>
        <p class="aboutMardi">In 2020, two parade attendees—one during the Nyx parade, and one during the Endymion
            parade, were killed
            after being
            struck and run over in between interconnected "tandem floats" towed by a single vehicle. Following the
            incident during
            the Nyx parade, there were calls for New Orleans officials to address safety issues with these floats
            (including
            outright bans, or requiring the gaps to be filled in using a barrier). Following the second death during the
            Endymion
            parade on February 22, 2020 (which caused the parade to be halted and cancelled), city officials announced
            that tandem
            floats would be banned effective immediately, with vehicles restricted to one, single float only.</p>
        <h3 class="h3About">Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
        <p class="aboutMardi">Unknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with
            parades running
            from January
            through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of coronavirus disease 2019
            (COVID-19) in the
            United States as part of a global epidemic. At the time, the disease was actively being dismissed as a
            major public
            health threat by President Donald Trump and his administration. As such, scrutiny over large public
            gatherings had
            yet to emerge, while scrutiny over international travel primarily placed an emphasis on restricting travel
            from
            China—the country from which the disease originated. The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was
            reported on
            March 9, two weeks after the end of Mardi Gras.

            Subsequently, the state of Louisiana saw a significant impact from the pandemic, with New Orleans in
            particular seeing a
            high rate of cases. Louisiana State University (LSU) associate professor Susanne Straif-Bourgeoi suggested
            that the
            rapid spread may have been aided by Mardi Gras festivities. Researchers of the University of
            Louisiana at
            Lafayette determined that Louisiana had the fastest growth rate of cases (67.8%, overtaking New York's 66.1%
            growth) in
            the 14 days since its first reported case than any region in the entire world.

            Mayor LaToya Cantrell stated that she would have cancelled Mardi Gras festivities had she been provided with
            sufficient
            warning by the federal government, and criticized the Trump administration for downplaying the
            threat. Amid
            continued spread of COVID-19 across the country, in early-November 2020 Cantrell stated that celebrations in
            2021 would
            have to be "something different", as Mardi Gras could not be canceled outright since it is a religious
            observance. A
            sub-committee of the Mardi Gras Advisory Committee focused on COVID-19 proposed that parades still be held
            but with
            strict safety protocols and recommendations, including enforcement of social distancing, highly recommending
            the wearing
            of face masks by attendees, discouraging "high value" throws in order to discourage crowding, as well as
            discouraging
            the consumption of alcohol, and encouraging more media coverage of parades to allow at-home viewing.
            On November 17, 2020, Mayor Cantrell's communications director Beau Tidwell announced that the city would
            prohibit
            parades during Carnival season in 2021. Tidwell once again stressed that Mardi Gras was not "cancelled", but
            that it
            would have to be conducted safely, and that allowing parades was not "responsible" as they can be
            superspreading
            events. This marked the first large-scale cancellation of Mardi Gras parades since the 1979 police
            strike. Other krewes subsequently announced that they would cancel their in-person balls, including
            Endymion and
            Rex (who therefore did not name a King and Queen of Mardi Gras for the first time since World War
            II).

            On February 5, 2021, in response to continued concerns surrounding "recent large crowds in the Quarter" and
            variants of
            SARS-CoV-2 as Shrove Tuesday neared, Mayor Cantrell ordered all bars in New Orleans (including those with
            temporary
            permits to operate as restaurants) to close from February 12 through February 16 (Mardi Gras), and
            prohibited to-go
            drink sales by restaurants, and all packaged liquor sales in the French Quarter. To discourage gatherings,
            pedestrian
            access to Bourbon Street, Decatur Street, Frenchmen Street between 7:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m., and Claiborne
            Avenue under
            the bridge, was restricted by checkpoints to those accessing businesses and homes within the areas. Mayor
            Cantrell
            stated that she would "rather be accused of doing too much than doing too little." The move caught some
            establishments
            off-guard, as they had been preparing for and anticipating business on Mardi Gras.

            Parades were allowed to return for 2022. In December 2021, the city announced that parades would have
            modified
            routes in 2022 due to New Orleans Police Department staffing shortages. On January 6, 2022, Mayor
            Cantrell
            stated during a kickoff event that "without a doubt, we will have Mardi Gras in 2022", citing high COVID-19
            vaccination
            rates, and customarily asked residents to "do everything that we know is necessary to keep our people safe."
            The Krewe
            de Jeanne D'Arc ceremonially led their parade with a group of marchers in plague doctor outfits and brooms,
            tasked to
            "sweep the plague away".31]

            The city announced COVID-19 protocols for Mardi Gras 2022 in February 2022, which requires, at a minimum,
            all
            participants in a parade (including marchers, performers, and those a riding a float) to present proof of
            vaccination or
            a negative COVID-19 test from within the past 72 hours. Some krewes chose to not accept negative tests at
            all, while
            some krewes (such as the Krewe of Muses, which also announced plans to have COVID-19 rapid tests as
            throws) had
            already announced vaccination requirements for parade participants ahead of the official requirement.
            Despite the
            presence of Omicron variant, city health director Jennifer Avegno stated that she was confident Mardi Gras
            could be
            conducted in a more normal fashion over 2021</p>

                <h2>LaToya Cantrell</h2>
                <h1> The mayor of New Orleans</h1>
                <p><b> Early life and education
                        Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend
                        Xavier
                        University of
                        Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training program at the
                        Harvard
                        Kennedy
                        School.</p></b>

                <p>Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined
                    the
                    board of the
                    Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the 2005
                    levee
                    failures in
                    Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and
                    remained
                    mostly
                    deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon
                    panel
                    convened by
                    then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans
                    neighborhoods to be
                    converted into greenspace.In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with
                    residents
                    and local
                    religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist
                    returning
                    Broadmoor
                    residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.
                    Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and
                    fellow
                    residents formed
                    the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson
                    school.She
                    served as a
                    founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation
                    that
                    provided case
                    management and other social services for returning residents.She was involved with residents'
                    efforts to
                    reopen
                    Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She
                    created a
                    partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which
                    provided
                    the
                    neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a
                    partnership
                    between the
                    Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the
                    Broadmoor Art and
                    Wellness Center.</p>
